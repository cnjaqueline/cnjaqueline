#### About me

:bank: I'm Software QA Analyst at Fitcard.

:mortar_board: Graduated in Computer Science from Candido Mendes University (UCAM) and post-graduated in Production and Systems from Instituto Federal Fluminense (IFF). 

:computer: I've a decade of experience with software development and I've worked in several development phases, from requirements to support systems in Production.
- In the quality area I've experience with defining test scenarios, E2E functional tests (manual and automated), API testing, exploratory testing.
- Currently, I've been dedicating myself to the study of test automation using Cypress in order to: 
1. Automate repetitive testing
2. Run faster tests
3. Run parallel tests
4. Allow integration of tests on CI / CD
- The choice of Cypress was due to some factors such as: being a tool that uses Javascript and Typescript, which leads to a low learning curve, has excellent documentation and community support, runs in "headless" mode and has several plugins.

:palm_tree: In my free time I enjoy nature walks with my family and try different foods.
